  "Ahh...Foulwater! A port city like no other." - the bartender says,
in the backgroud you hear gunfire followed by lady-laugh - "Home to serpent 
hunter, dog ganks and all manner of weird and wounderful folk from across the
known world." - his green devilish eyes turn on you - "No better place
to seek your fortune and earn your name. Tread careful tho..." - you can see
his yellow teeth bend in a grinning smile - "Your purse AND your throat will
be cut as soon as you step on the street. There is no law in Foulwater after
all.". The bartender pours some ale and passes it to a hooded figure, standing 
near you and continues - "It's an old place and has its fair share of miths
and legends, who even know how many are true. But... if it's stories you're 
after, well..." - he starts laughing - "You've come to the right place."
