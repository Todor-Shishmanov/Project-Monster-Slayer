#  "Naw, naw...that seat is not taken?" - asks a bearded figure, but before you can
say anything he continues: 

 - "Pull un a leg and sick a few, friend" - you get a good look on his face, bald and old,
those two words describe him perfectly. - "Aye, my friend, I am "Last", that's what the boys
call me anyways. Seen afew shipwrecks, but been the last lad on me foot everytime. That was
back when i was like you, heh... You wanna know? It was Ophidian, the name of that ship, 
now down beneath the iron-black water. Maybe ye buys me a bear and I tell you about it?"

#You place few silver coins and the bartender takes them. One glass of fine bear is placed
between you and the old pirate. 
 
- "Oh, come on lad, get yourself one too!" 
You check your purse. Sadly you see only one coin laying there. You place it on the desk, but the old pirate says

 - "Oh, that coin ain't for spending. Put it back, this one is on me." - You take a good look at the coin,
it was a silver coin, just like the rest, except had a kraken carved in it. Probably the last owner
didn't have better things to do with his knife...

 - It's a lucky kraken, you have to pay the Tide after all... - he says

#  - The Tide?...You know, THE Tide... Are you telling me you don't know the Tide? EVERYBODY knows the Tide...
Pay the tide or face the ocean's wrath?

Oh, by the Bearded Lady... Then you never heard o Nautilus, either? The Titan of the Depths?

Barkeep! Pour us a round, barkeep, there's a good lass. This is a tale that needs an ale, as they say... 
and my friend here's buyin'." - he takes the glass and leaves it dry.

 - "Ahh, that's the good stuff, that is."

# - "Twas almost thirty years back, now, returning from a hunt. I was a harpooner, finest shot in the Slaughter Fleets. 
We'd caught ourselves an axe-fin leviathanaye, one o them big, mean boggersand we was haulin' 
the beast back to port. It were just before dawn. 
Folwater's city lights flickered in the distance, beckonin' us in. There were razorfish and berserker sharks 
following close by, cos the axe-fin was oozing into the water, see.

And our captain... Well, none of us much cared for him. Untrustworthy sort. He swears blind he paid the 
Tide ‘afore we left. "A single gold Kraken," the captain said, "for tis all I have to give.", stupid gal-like fucker."

But none of us seen him throw it over the side, now did we. So, naturally we was suspicious, cos we knew 
he was a tight-fisted old wharf rat. But on we sailed anyway.

#And that was when the Titan hit us.

Without warning, this bloody great anchor comes at us from below. Smashed clean through the keel, 
up through the main deck. Caught us tight, and started pullin' us down... Oh, it was chaos, friend. 
Sailors thrown overboard. The waters churnin', scavengers feedin'. I grabs the captain, screamin' at him, 
"You’re a liar! This is the Lady’s punishment for those as don't pay!"

The ship was going down fast. But then the planking gave way, didn' it, and the anchor slid back into the depths. 
If it had ended then, more of us might've got away.

But it weren't over. Nautilus weren't done wi' us yet.

#The ship tipped to starboard, right-sudden. It was the weight of the Titan himself, hauling up onto the deck. 
Perhaps once it'd been a man, but it weren't no man I saw that night, risin' from the waves. 
I has our captain by the throat. "This is your doing!" I roared, as I chokes the bastard, his eyes wide. 
He can see Nautilus is comin’ for us...

So I shoves the captain away, down the slanted deck, and this thing catches him in one hand, if you can believe it! 
It was so big, the fingers closed completely around 'is bodyand the captain weren't a small man by any stretch.

"There’s your Tide!" I yells, and jumped overboard.

I dunno how long I was in the water. Must've only been seconds, but it felt like an age. But the sea scavengers didn't get me, 
Mother Serpent be praised. Pulled myself up onto one of them stone pinnacles, out there in the Straits, 
an I watched the Ophidian sink.

Nautilus still held the captain, squirmin' and wrigglin' like a stuck worm, but there were no escapin' that grasp. 
The Titan was just standing there, motionless as a statue. I watched them go down, down into the darkness.

#- Why spare me? Don't rightly know. Perhaps I was the only one to make an offering. Or maybe Nautilus 
wanted someone left alive, to tell the tale. But on the darkest Bilgewater nights, when the murder-fogs roll in, 
ye might hear 'im wading out from the shallows, slow and steady like, draggin' that accursed anchor in his wake...

Want my advice, friend? Keep a coin in your pocket, and always pay the Tide. 
And don’t trust no captain who says he's done it, less you seen it for yourself.

After all, ye might not be so lucky as me.
What was you're name again? Don't think I heard it.
Choose your name: 

# - Glad to meet ya! 

 - Right-o Last,that's enough for one night. You're bothering my other customers - the bartender says

 - Alrights, alrights, fine. How's about one for the road, though? Somethin' to get me movin', eh?

 - Nuh-uh, not until you settle up. I'll not serve you tomorrow, either. Not until you pay your
considerable tab...

 - Ahh, that's fair enough. - Last, the old pirate stands and heads towards the door. - I'll see you anon.

He starts humming some old pirate song and opens the doors.

Couple of hours pass...

The bartender tells you: 

 - Closing time, gotta go now lad. You watch yourself out there, because life is cheap in Foulwater. It's all a cycle
ain't it. Old legends fade and new, darker ones are born. That's just the way of things... always has been.
So don't trust anybody, keep one eye on the shadows and maybe, just maybe...
we'll see you again sometime.
